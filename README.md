# CosseratRod-RKMK

Single degree of freedom joint actuated dynamic Cosserat rod simulator derived on a Lie group framework. System of PDEs are solved using the finite difference method with RKMK geometric integrators. 

Download all files and ensure Library folder is in the same directory as RunMe_InvDyn(). Can modify the simulated trajectory or discretization in this file. The properties of the simulated body are loaded from and can be modified in defPaperSample_1(). Output animation of the dynamic response is generated as a .gif file and also plotted in the Matlab environment. Comprehensive collection of all simulations in the paper are not provided, but this program was modified for the varying discretizations to generate all of the plots in the paper. 

Thank you for checking out the code, and please reach out to me at "hossainsamei@cmail.carleton.ca" should you have any questions, comments or concerns.
